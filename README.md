# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the GUI.

## Description

This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all spaces on the board are filled and no winner is determined.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) implemented with Tkinter.
- Random selection of starting player.
- Ability to reset the game.

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using Python.
2. Click on any empty cell in the 3x3 grid to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game will alternate turns between the two players until a winner is determined or the board is full.
4. If there is a winner, the winning marks will be highlighted in green.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
